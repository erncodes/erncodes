An aspiring fullstack developer, tech fanatic with a background in sales.<br/> I wrote my first "Hello World" code just about over a year ago. At the begining, it was just an experimental rush or i could say it was another attempt to explore the world around me a bit more. Exciting moment it was! i just had to relive that moment. As my intrigue grew, i realized that there was a part of me that felt heard or for lack of a better word 'useful' when writing code, my artistic self.<br/> Seeing the wonderful impact of computer logic around the world, everything began to make sense.<br/> Developing apps made sense, and it was then i decided that this is the way i want to contribute to this world. So i started my journey with learning the following technologies and i have managed to build some apps with their aid.
